    <h1> 2-May-2023: --School Laptops; The ONLY Laptop Options-- </h1>
    <p>
      AllenISD has decided to completely remove personal devices starting the 2023-2024 schoolyear. While Allen used to have a BYOD policy, after the introduction of shitty, small, horible devices, they believe that a total ban on personal devices should be put into place. This will not only affect students learning, as they have to use different devices to learn, but also how teacher teach, as many teachers allow students have project centered around being online.
