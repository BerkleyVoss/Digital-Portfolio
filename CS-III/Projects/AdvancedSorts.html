    <h1>MergeSort</h1>
    <p>
      Time Complexity: n(log(n)<br>
      Space Complexity: n
      <br><br>
      Merge sort splits an array in half repeatedly until there are inindividual elements, then combines them while ordering them.

    <h1>QuickSort</h1>
    <p>
      Time Complexity: O(n log(n))<br>
      Space Complexity: O(log(n))
      <br><br> 
      In quick sort an element in the array is selected as the pivot then the array is split into less than or greater than / equil to the pivot. Another pivot is chosen for both splits, then they are split, until the entire array has been spilt and sorted, then the array is put back together in the seperated order.

    <h1>HeapSort</h1>
    <p>
      Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))<br>
      Space Complexity: O(1)
      <br><br> 
      Heap sort splits the array with a center element first, the next two starting branches, until the entire array is branching off. Then the elements areswaped up untill the largest number is at the top, the nit is swaped to the last element and removed from the branches and placed in a sorted array. This ordering to largest and removal repeats until all the branches are sorted.
