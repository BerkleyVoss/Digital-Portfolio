      <b>5.1</b>  What are these sets? Write them explicitly, listing their members.
      <br>
      <br>(a) {4,6}
      <br>(b) {{8}, {7,8}, {8,9}, {7,8,9}}
      <br>(c) {}
      <br>(d) {(1,0), (3,0), (5,0)}
      <br>(e) {}
      <br>(f) {(,), (,{0}), ({1},), ({0},{1})}
      <br>(g) {,{,2},{{2}}, {}}
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>5.3</b> Show that if A is a finite set with |A| = n, then |P(A)| = 2^|A|. 
      <br> |P(A)| = 2 to the power of |A|
      <br>
      <b>5.5</b>
      <br>(a) Suppose A and B are finite sets. Compare the two quantities |P(AxB)| and |P(A)|.|P(B)| Under what circumstances is one larger than the other, and what is their ratio?
      <br> 
      <br>(b) Is it inevitably true that (A-B)n(B-A) = 0? Prove it or give a counterexample.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>5.7</b> Decide whether each statement is true or false and why:
      <br>(a)
      <br>(b) false because 0 is a number, nothing is not equal to 0
      <br>(c) True the concatination of no items is zero
      <br>(d) 
      <br>(e) 
      <br>(f) 
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>5.9</b> Prove the following.
      <br>(a) add set A to set B, take all values of A from set AB, is set A = set A
      <br>(b) distribute the A to (BnC) and flip the n is (A-B)u(A-C) = (A-B)u(A-C)
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>5.11</b> Suppose we do not accept ordered pairs as primitive, and instead define [x,y] to be {x{x,y}}. Prove that [x,y] = [u,v] if and only if x = u and y = v.
