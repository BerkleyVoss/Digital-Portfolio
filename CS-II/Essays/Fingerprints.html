      The two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection are to create secure data trasfer and preventing eavesdropping. A HTTPS proxy alliance enables a thord party to bypass the scurity of a website to see everything you do while online. A MITM is a type of eavesdropping where someone cuts into a connection or call between you and another system, in order to listen into your conversation and/or acctions. A hash is a type of encoding used to secure websites. A CA is a system that signs a third party check that an internet browser can use to authenticate a website. SSL interception cannot be prevented, but it can be detected by comparing the security certificate of the website to what the website tells you it should be. A false-positive may come from the way you typed the websites name, weather you used a www or not. A false-negative may come about if a certain website or person is excluded from SSL interception, this may allow you to think that you aren't being intercepted when you are. My school does have SSL interception, but they souldn't considering how they use it. If they didn't get in the way of computer focused classes, and instead just stored data, then it may be ok, but instead they continue to hamper classes and don't even make an effort to do anything with the data they collect. My school should not have the right to eavesdrop on me they way they do.
