	  <h3 style="font-size:18px;">The two primary purposes of a secure HTTPS connection are to secure data transfers and to prevent eavesdropping.(Gibson, 2020) An HTTPS proxy alliance enables a third party to bypass the security of a website to see everything you do while online.(Gibson, 2020) A MITM is a type of eavesdropping where someone cuts into a connection or call between you and another system, in order to listen into your conversation and/or actions.(Gibson, 2020) A hash is a type of encoding used to secure websites.(Gibson, 2020) A CA is a system that signs a third-party check that an internet browser can use to authenticate a website.(Gibson, 2020) SSL interception cannot be prevented, but can be detected by comparing the security certificate to what the website tells you it should be.(Gibson, 2020) A false positive may come from the way you typed the website's name, whether you used a www or not.(Gibson, 2020) A false negative may come about if a certain website or person is excluded from SSL interception.(Gibson, 2020) This may allow you to think that you aren't being intercepted when you are. My school does have SSL interception, but they shouldn't considering how they use it. If they didn't get in the way of computer-focused classes, and instead just stored data, then it may be ok, but instead, they continue to hamper classes and don't even make an effort to do anything with the data they collect. My school should not have the right to eavesdrop on me the way they do.
