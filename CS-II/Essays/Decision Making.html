    <h3>Bias Essay</h3>    
    <h4>
      Most biases and fallacies that effect people come from ideas or values that are held in the human subconscious. Knowing about them allows us to find ways to stop biases and fallacies from affecting us. These biases and fallacies can come from past experiences or can be constructed off of what we already know.
      <br>The Effort Justification is someone's tendency to attribute a value to an outcome, that they had to put effort into achieving, greater than the objective value of the outcome. (Wikipedia) I believe this bias effects could be negated by stepping back and evaluating your work and getting someone else's opinion. While this could also be solved by simply not attaching a value to something until it is done, I believe that it would be more difficult to not value something while making it.
      <br>The Planning Fallacy is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task underestimate the time needed. (Wikipedia) I think that since this fallacy stems from an underestimation, all that someone would need to do is add extra time in case they underestimated. I believe this fallacy may have already happened to my group, because we have just started planning our ISP and we need to make plans to start earlier than we planned.
      <br>The G.I. Joe Fallacy is the tendency to think that knowing about cognitive bias is enough to overcome it. (Wikipedia) This fallacy might happen when people realize the biases and fallacies around them. It can most likely be combated by knowing that most biases and fallacies  are in the subconscious, and cannot be entirely avoided. I think this fallacy may effect my team because they have all looked into biases and may be susceptible to it now.
      <br>Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs. This may also cause the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation. (Wikipedia) The bias of groupthink lies in not wanting to engage in conflict. In order to escape this fallacy, one should engage in polite and constructive critiques. It will also help eliminate the overlook of evaluation of opinions. I think this may impact my teams decision because we don’t know everyone in our group and may think to get along instead of figuring out the ISP.
      <br>Normalcy Bias, or normality bias, is a cognitive bias that leads people to ignore the possibility of disaster because it has not happened yet. (Wikipedia) Since this bias comes from ignorance, one way to avoid it is to continuously learn about what is around you.
      In conclusion, knowing the fallacies and biases that affect us, can allow us to know when we have been affected by them. These biases, while not the only things that could affect our decisions, are probably going to effect the end result of our ISP, and other projects.
