	    AI will not intentionally cause humanitys downfall. AI have been in use since 1951 first created by Christopher Strachey. They "require strick safty proticols in order to be used commercially". These include restrictions by the "FDA, FTC, as well as the CFPB, and EEOC" (Advancing Trustworthy AI). The US government has even posted guidelines for the use of AI on www.ai.gov. With all of this regulation and cooperation between AI makers and the government, it seems almost immposible for an unsafe AI to be made or continue to exist.
	    MIT "elite researchers in artificial intelligence predicted that 'human level machine intelligence,' or HLMI, has a 50 percent chance of occurring within 45 years and a 10 percent chance of occurring within 9 years"(Blais 2022). Even with these odds, AI will likely need more years after being developed in order to be introduced to the world.
