      AI will not intentionally cause humanitys downfall. AI have been in use since 1951 first created by Christopher Strachey. They require strick safty proticols in order to be used commercially. These include restrictions by the FDA, FTC, as well as the CFPB, and EEOC (Advancing Trustworthy AI). The US gov has even posted guidelines for the use of AI (Legislation and Executive Orders). With all of this regulation and cooperation between AI makers and the gov, it seems almost immposible for an unsafe AI to be made or continue to exist.
