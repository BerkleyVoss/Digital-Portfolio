	   My plans this week are the same as last week. 
	    <br><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-Tempora/issues/29">This weeks issues</a>
	    <br>I have come to the realization that even if everyone who is in my group starts to code, we will not get done fast enough. So I have decided that I will use the backgrounds that have been made, and ut them into a google presentation.
	    <br><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-Tempora/issues/29"><img src=""></a>
	    Challenges:
	    <br> Noone besides the person who made all of the backgrounds, sounds, and story, has helped code, even when asked and assigned code to do. I have made all of the code myself and cannot finish it in time.

	    One scheduling challenge I faced this week was that I had to prepare for a test. Unlike other weeks, because I had to study and prepare for a test, I didn't get as much work done on the ISP. I would have liked to have more time to do the ISP, but studying comes before the ISP.
	    <br><br>
	    One technical challege I encountered was that my wifi went out. The wifi at my house went out, so I couldn't do my online homework or the online parts of the ISP for a couple of days. This, combined with multiple tests I needed to study for, caused a bit of a challenging week to get everything done on time. 
	    <br><br>
	    One interpersonal challenge was getting work done, because of this week being hectic many stopped the ISP to study for the SQL test. Since everyone paused what they were doing on the ISP, it was difficultto get everyone back on track and doing the ISP.

	    One scheduling challenge I faced this week was that I only had one class period this week for work. Since a few of my team menbers are in the same class period as me we usually converse on how the project is going, but since there was only two days I had Computer Science II and one of those days was a lecture for a test I did not have as much time to discuss the ISP in person.
	    <br><br>
	    One technical challenge I encountered was hashing out all of the plans for the varius puzzles in our game. Because the game is a puzzle game, there needs to be puzzles, but making creative and fun puzzles takes a lot of time. An additional thing to think about when making the puzzles was items and other smaller puzzles to lead up to the more complicated ones. 
	    <br><br>
	    One interpersonal challenge was dealing with one group member who thought the game was going to be something different. The team member beleived that the game was going to be entirly different then what had been planed. Thankfully, other group menbers and I managed to correct the misunderstanding, but their constantly arguing to change the game because of their misunderstanding ate up time and soured the atmosphere.

	    One scheduling challenge I faced was that, besides e-mail, since some of my group members were in other class periods, I had no way of contacting them. I decided to get evryones phone number, but now have to wait for them to e-mail me their numbers.
	    <br><br>
	    One technical challenge  was figuring out how to finalize the outline of our project. Since we never finalized the outline of our project, we had a difficult time finding where to start. We decided to start finalizing out project and setting it in stone.
	    <br><br>
	    One Interpersonal challenge was that is was frusterating getting everyones contacts. Since I had a limmited amount of contact with them I used phone numbers, but this lead to having to get everyones phonenumber. This was not an easy task with students I didn't know or wernt in my class period, but I managed to get everyones number eventually.

	    Software development engineers design and build software. They will usually work with other engineers, or on a team, to figure out the best way to make the software. They also confer with managers on the specifics of the software.
	    <br><br>
	    QA engineers check code and run it for bugs. They make specific tests based on the requirments for the code. They can work with a team, or just a single software development engineer.
	    <br><br>
	    Project managers are responcible for planning and keeping everyone in their team on track. They usually work with a team and have specifics they need to make that team follow. They also guide teams throught time constraignts and project demands. 
	    <br><br>
	    Product managers are responcible for making sure the product stays on plan and works as it should. They, like project managers, also work with a team and have constraignts on time and certain aspects that need to be completed. Unlike project managers, product managers are more focused on the product than giuding the team.
	    <br><br>
	    Release engineers work with software development engineers to plan out the software. They will work together to perfect the code plan before the software engineer starts coding. The release engineer can work with an entire team of others to perfect the code plan.
